Here I am looking over my personal space craft and the space station in our space world.
In space aerodynamics are not very important so I make my ship is almost entirely based on function, only modifying shape if they accidentally turn out looking slightly normal. This results in bazaar ships that my kids laugh at, but seems to work for me.
As you can see I have some extra items in my ship that are not in the file I showed you. You will have to edit your spaceship.craft file to make those work.
Now I am inside my ship. You can see it is mostly made of glass because after all I want to see what is going on.
I am going to right click on the space ship sign. Now I am successfully piloting. Now I am going to head toward the space station and dock.
We like to use redstone blocks as docking pylons to help us know where to go.
Each dock is specific for the ship.
Oops, you can see I got stuck.
Here we go now. I have made a docking guide here. You just have to look at the guide and dock right into it.
Now it is telling me I cannot go any further, I am in my dock.
If we walk through here we can see that the dock here is made specifically for my ship so that I can make an air tight seal with the ship even with the stairs and the space station.
We can walk right into the space station. Now it is telling me I left my ship so we'll soon let go of control of it. I'll use my top command to jump into space to take a look.
There you can see the space ship docked neatly with the space station. My pylons stick out, some are held with ropes. There is the space station and my ship and some ships my kids created: a bus over there and a tug over there and there are some planets in space and there is my daughter's wookie world.
One thing you'll notice in space is that it is a lot faster just to fly as yourself than in a ship, but the ships are a lot of fun.
I hope you enjoyed this video. Bye-bye.
